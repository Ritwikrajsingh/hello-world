# 🧠 Programming Notes & Concepts

Welcome to my **personal programming journey**. This repository is where I document, explore, and revise everything I learn in the world of programming. From the basics to more advanced topics in data structures, algorithms, and language-specific concepts - it's all here.

I treat this as my digital notebook. A place not just to revise but also to reflect on how far I've come and where I still need to go.

## 📌 What's in here?

This repository will grow over time and currently includes or may include:

### 🔹 Data Structures

Arrays, strings, linked lists, hash tables

<!-- Trees, graphs, heaps, stacks, queues   -->

My own notes, visualizations, and frequently asked interview problems

### 🔹 Algorithms

Sorting and searching  
Recursion and backtracking

<!-- Greedy, dynamic programming, divide and conquer   -->
<!-- Graph algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's   -->

Multiple approaches to the same problem (brute force, optimized, edge cases)

### 🔹 Language-Specific Notes

<!-- Python (my first love in programming)   -->
<!-- Java (helped me understand OOP deeply)   -->
<!-- JavaScript (mostly for web and async behavior)   -->

Syntax, patterns, quirks, idioms - the small things that matter

### 🔹 Interview Prep

My take on commonly asked problems  
Solutions in different styles: brute force, optimized, edge-focused  
Time and space complexity for each  
My own learnings, tricks, and mental models

<!-- ## 📂 Structure

As this is a living repository, things may move around as I reorganize and improve the structure. -->

## 📖 Why this repo?

I'm a self-learner and a backend engineer by training. I believe in revisiting the basics often. Writing things down, breaking them apart, and trying to explain them (even if it's just to myself) helps me understand better. This repo is a space for:

-   My raw learning process
-   My progress over time
-   Making mistakes, correcting them, and learning out loud

## ✅ How to Use

You’re welcome to:

-   Look around for notes, examples, or patterns
-   Fork this repo and use it as a base for your own learning
-   Create issues or discussions if anything seems unclear or incorrect - open to feedback any time

## 📅 Updates

I update this whenever I:

-   Solve something new
-   Learn or revisit a concept
-   Refactor older code to make it cleaner or faster

Stick around. There's more to come.
